# nookbot-availability

Generate images showing the availabilities of fish, insects and sea creatures in Animal Crossing New Horizons for use with NookBot.

Images are generated as a 12x24 grid of squares, where the colour of the square indicates whether the entity is available at that time of day or not.

The following is an example of an availability image.
